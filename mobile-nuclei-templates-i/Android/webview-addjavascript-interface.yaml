  name: Webview addJavascript Interface Usage
  author: mohammad
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Detects the usage of WebView's `addJavascriptInterface` method, which can introduce security vulnerabilities.
    This method allows JavaScript to access Android object methods, which could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data or features.
  reference:
    - https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView#addJavascriptInterface(java.lang.Object,%20java.lang.String)
  remediation: |
    Avoid using `addJavascriptInterface` with untrusted JavaScript content.
    If necessary, restrict the interface to only trusted sources and limit the exposed methods to reduce the attack surface.
    Consider using other mechanisms such as WebView's `postMessage` for more secure communication.
