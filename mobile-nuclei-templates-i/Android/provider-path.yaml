  name: Insecure Provider Path
  author: mohammad
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Detects insecure provider paths in Android apps that could expose sensitive data.
    Specifically, it looks for content provider paths with insecure configurations, such as those that are set to root paths (i.e., `"path" = "."` or `""`), allowing unrestricted access.
  reference:
    - https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProvider
  remediation: |
    Avoid using insecure provider paths that allow unrestricted access to sensitive data. 
    Ensure that content provider paths are appropriately secured by limiting access and restricting permissions.
    Consider using more restrictive path configurations and securing content provider permissions.
