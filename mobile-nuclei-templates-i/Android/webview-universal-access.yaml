    Detects if the `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs()` method is enabled in WebView settings, which can allow file URLs to access content from other origins, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing cross-origin attacks.
    This method, when enabled, allows JavaScript running in a WebView to access resources from file:// URLs, which may lead to security risks like unauthorized file access or exposure of sensitive data.
  reference:
    - https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings#setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs(boolean)
  remediation: |
    Disable universal access from file URLs unless absolutely necessary. This can be done by calling `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs(false)` on the WebViewâ€™s settings object.
    Limiting access to trusted sources and applying additional security measures, such as restricting access to local file systems, can also mitigate potential risks.
    Ensure proper sanitization of any user inputs or untrusted content loaded in the WebView.
