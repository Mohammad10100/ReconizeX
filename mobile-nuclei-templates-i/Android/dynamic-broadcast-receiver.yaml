  name: Dynamic Registered Broadcast Receiver
  author: mohammad
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Detects the use of dynamically registered broadcast receivers in Android apps. 
    Dynamically registered receivers can be registered at runtime, potentially exposing the app to risks such as unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
  reference:
    - https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver
  remediation: |
    It's recommended to statically register critical broadcast receivers in the AndroidManifest.xml instead of dynamically at runtime.
    If dynamic registration is necessary, ensure the receiver is properly secured and validate incoming intents to mitigate the risk of malicious broadcasts.
