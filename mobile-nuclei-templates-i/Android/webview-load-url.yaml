  severity: medium
  description: |
    Detects usage of the `loadUrl` method in WebView, which can pose security risks if used improperly.
    Loading untrusted URLs in WebView can lead to various vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data leakage, or unauthorized actions.

  remediation: |
    Avoid loading untrusted URLs in WebViews, especially URLs with user input.
    If loading external content, ensure that the URLs are trusted and properly sanitized.
    Additionally, consider using `WebView.loadData` with sanitized content or implement more restrictive loading policies like whitelisting domains.
