  description: |
    Detects Twitter API keys or secrets, which are used to authenticate applications to access Twitter data. These keys provide access to Twitter accounts and can be misused to post tweets, access private data, or perform other actions on behalf of the user. Exposure of these keys can lead to unauthorized access and potential abuse.
  remediation: |
    - Immediately revoke any exposed Twitter API keys or secrets in the Twitter Developer Dashboard.
    - Regenerate new API keys and update your application to use the new keys.
    - Store your keys in a secure location, such as environment variables or a secrets manager, rather than hard-coding them in source files.
    - Regularly rotate your API keys to reduce the risk of long-term exposure.
