  name: S3 Bucket Detect
  author: mohammad
  severity: info
  description: |
    Detects potential references to Amazon S3 buckets in the source code.
    Publicly exposed S3 buckets may lead to data leaks, unauthorized access, and security risks.
  remediation: |
    - Ensure that S3 buckets are private unless explicitly required to be public.
    - Use AWS IAM policies to control access to the bucket and restrict permissions.
    - Enable logging and monitoring to detect unauthorized access.
    - Regularly audit S3 bucket permissions and use encryption for stored data.
    - Avoid hardcoding S3 bucket URLs in source code. Instead, use environment variables or configuration files.
