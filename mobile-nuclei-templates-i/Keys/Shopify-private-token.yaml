  severity: high
  description: |
    Detects Shopify Private App Access Tokens, which allow direct API access to a store.
    If exposed, an attacker can potentially access or modify store data without authentication.
  remediation: |
    - Revoke any exposed tokens immediately from the Shopify admin panel.
    - Avoid hardcoding tokens in source code; use environment variables or a secure vault instead.
    - Limit API permissions to the minimum required for the appâ€™s functionality.
    - Regularly audit API access and rotate tokens periodically to reduce security risks.
