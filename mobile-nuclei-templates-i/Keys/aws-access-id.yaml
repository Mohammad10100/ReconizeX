  name: AWS Access Key ID Exposure
  author: mohammad
  severity: high
  description: |
    Detects hardcoded AWS Access Key IDs in decompiled APKs. 
    Exposed credentials can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and AWS resource abuse.
  reference:
    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html
  remediation: |
    - Revoke the exposed AWS Access Key immediately from the AWS IAM console.
    - Rotate AWS keys and update them securely in a vault or environment variables.
    - Implement IAM roles and temporary credentials instead of hardcoding secrets.
