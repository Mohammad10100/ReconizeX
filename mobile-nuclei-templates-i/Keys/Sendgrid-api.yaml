    Detects Sendgrid API keys, which are used for authenticating and sending emails via the Sendgrid service.
    Exposure of this key can allow unauthorized email sending, potential spam, and account misuse.
  remediation: |
    - Revoke the exposed API key immediately and generate a new one from the Sendgrid dashboard.
    - Update all applications using the key with the new, securely stored key.
    - Avoid hardcoding API keys in source code. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system.
    - Regularly audit your codebase and repositories for exposed credentials.
