  severity: high
  description: |
    Detects Shopify Custom App Access Tokens, which can provide full API access to a Shopify store.
    If exposed, an attacker may gain unauthorized access to sensitive store data, modify settings, or perform transactions.
  remediation: |
    - Revoke any exposed tokens immediately from the Shopify admin panel.
    - Avoid hardcoding tokens in source code; use environment variables or secure vaults instead.
    - Restrict API permissions to only what's necessary for the application.
    - Regularly audit and rotate tokens to minimize exposure risks.
