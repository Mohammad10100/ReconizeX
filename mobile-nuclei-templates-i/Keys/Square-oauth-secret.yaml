info:
  name: Square OAuth Secret
  author: mohammad
  severity: high
  description: |
    Detects Square OAuth secrets, which are used for OAuth authentication with Square's API. These secrets are sensitive and should be kept private. If exposed, attackers can misuse them to authenticate as the owner of the OAuth connection, potentially gaining access to restricted data or performing unauthorized actions on the Square platform.
  remediation: |
    - Immediately revoke the OAuth secret if exposed or compromised.
    - Regenerate the OAuth secret and update your application to use the new secret.
    - Store secrets securely in environment variables or secret management systems.
    - Restrict API access using OAuth scopes and permissions to minimize risk.
