  name: Slack API Key
  author: mohammad
  severity: high
  description: |
    Detects Slack API keys used to authenticate with Slack's API endpoints. These keys can provide unauthorized access to Slack workspaces, channels, messages, and other sensitive data.
    If exposed, attackers can take control of Slack integrations and bots, access private messages, and potentially leak sensitive business information.
  remediation: |
    - Revoke and regenerate the API key immediately.
    - Ensure API keys are stored securely using environment variables or secret management systems.
    - Implement OAuth for more secure and scoped API access.
    - Regularly audit and review API keys and integrations.
    - Avoid hardcoding keys in source code and use proper access control mechanisms.
