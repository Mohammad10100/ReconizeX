  name: Android Insecure RC4 Cipher Usage
  author: mohammad
  severity: warning
  description: |
    Detects the use of the insecure RC4 (ARCFOUR) cipher in Smali bytecode, which is vulnerable to cryptographic attacks.
    RC4 has known weaknesses, including biases and susceptibility to plaintext recovery attacks.
    It is recommended to replace RC4 with AES for better security.
